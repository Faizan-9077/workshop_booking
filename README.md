# Workshop Booking ‚Äì UI/UX Enhancement

This repository contains my submission for **FOSSEE Python Screening Task 1: UI/UX Enhancement**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What I Changed

- **CSS Enhancements:** Improved responsiveness, readability, and consistency across multiple pages (login, register, profile, dashboard, workshop status).  
- **Template Improvements:** Updated `base.html` with a responsive navbar and footer; refined form layouts and spacing in templates.  
- **Code Cleanup:** Removed unnecessary comments from CSS and templates for a cleaner codebase.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Design Principles Followed

- **Clarity & Readability** ‚Üí Improved typography, spacing, and alignment.  
- **Consistency** ‚Üí Unified buttons, forms, and colors across all pages.  
- **Mobile-first Approach** ‚Üí Designed layouts to work well on small screens first.  
- **Accessibility** ‚Üí Ensured proper color contrast and semantic HTML usage.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring Responsiveness

- Integrated **Bootstrap 5** grid system for layout control.  
- Used **flexbox and media queries** for smoother resizing.  
- Tested on **mobile, tablet, and desktop** viewports.  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Trade-offs Between Design and Performance

- Adding Bootstrap slightly increased CSS size but provided **consistent responsive behavior**.  
- Avoided heavy JS libraries to keep load times fast.  
- Kept custom CSS minimal and avoided duplication to ensure maintainability.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges Faced

- Refactoring **table-based layouts** into **card-based layouts** without breaking Django logic.  
- Making **profile and workshop status pages** readable on smaller screens.  
- Ensuring that Django‚Äôs **template inheritance** remained intact after restructuring.
